# ReMap - How to contribute

First of all: Feel free to contribute to this project! We appreciate any help to develop this library and make it nice, stable and feature complete.

The ReMap project was started to minimize the need of converter classes and corresponding unit tests. There are features that require a user to write tests and therefore are not added to the library. We try to check every new feature carefully before merging pull requests!

This project provides a checkstyle rule configuration as well as formatter configurations for Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.

The formatter configurations of both supported IDEs were created to produce similar outputs. Although there are slightly different formattings, the outputs should be compliant to the Checkstyle rule set.

## Contribution checklist

The following list summarizes the things you should check before contributing:

- build pipeline is successfull
- README was extended
- tests were added
- if you add or change a ReMap mapping feature, please provide a corresponding assert
feature. ReMap has an assert API for mapper testing which must be extended accordingly.
- your changes in the public API should be backwards compatible. This is a bit challenging, because we
currently have no testing for that.
- if you added dependencies to ReMap, please make sure the dependencies are actively
maintained. You may want to give us a hint/link or GitHub page to speed up reviews ;)

## Contributing Features

When contributing features, any suggestions to extend the README of this project are welcome :-)

### Testing features

When writing test for this project, please make sure to create a new package for your test. This avoids unnecessary dependencies to other test classes.

## Contributing bug fixes

When contributing bug fixes, please first write a test that provokes the bug. Please use the package `com.remondis.remap.regression` for that.

## Contribution resources

You can find the IDE formatter and the Checkstyle rule set in `shared/config`.
